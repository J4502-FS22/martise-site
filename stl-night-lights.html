      <h1>St. Louis Night Lights</h1>
      <p>These images all display different aspects of St. Louis night scenes using light as a decorative element to the images’ creations. As a born-and-raised St. Louis area resident, I have seen these nightly images of St. Louis in many different occasions and ways throughout my lifetime. I want to display my own photography from my recent years photographing moments of night scenes in St. Louis to give others a sense of how I see the beauty of my area at night.</p>
